# Lost.ub
 An open sourced, free, safe to use discord user bot.
 Please note: Although it works for the most part, I am currently not focused on maintaining it. I will work on it whenever I have the time for it.

# Installation

**Python 3.8 or higher is required, [install here.](https://www.python.org/)**

### 1. Required Python Libraries

Download the requirements.txt from the repository.

Open explorer to the folder in which you've downloaded requirements.txt,

and type and enter `cmd` into the [explorer address bar](https://i.ibb.co/C0PNVW1/Screenshot-4.png)

Now enter the command below to install all the required libraries/packages.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Git
- [Link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

This is absolutely necessary as git allows lost.ub to check for updates for each individual file.

Without this, the program will not run and will produce errors.

### 3. Finalization
Download and install `bot.pyw` and place it in it's own dedicated folder.

Open it **once** and wait for it to create all the files necessary for it to run.

You can tell when it's done if the "repo" folder disappears, otherwise it's still running or it encountered an error.

Now open "config.ini" and put your discord user token where it says "TOKEN", and feel free to change any other settings
to your liking.

Open "bot.py" once more and in a few seconds it will create it's own dedicated discord server where it will log things
such as command usage, errors, and other neat things.

You are now finished with the lost.ub installation.

If you have encountered any bugs please join the discord server down below, as I would love to help you out and fix issues.

# Disclaimer
Lost.ub is safe itself, however, whatever you do with this will determine your outcome. Spamming, ghostpinging, and overall
just abusing lost.ub's features is probably not a good idea. That being said, I am not responsible for any bans, discord terminations, 
or any other consequences that may occur when using this. Use this wisely.
